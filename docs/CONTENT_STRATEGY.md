## What is AEO/GEO?

The way people find information has fundamentally changed. Search engines are no longer the only gatekeepers — AI answer engines are now the first touchpoint for millions of queries. Our content strategy needs to optimize for both.

### AEO — Answer Engine Optimization

AEO is the practice of making content **extractable and citable by AI answer engines** — ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Claude, and whatever comes next.

When someone asks an AI "how do I host an AI agent?", the AI assembles an answer from sources it trusts. AEO ensures Sparebox content is one of those sources.

**Key principle:** Write content that an AI can directly quote as a confident, authoritative answer.

### GEO — Generative Engine Optimization

GEO goes a step further: optimizing specifically for **citations in AI-generated answers**. When an AI generates a response, GEO ensures Sparebox is named, linked, or referenced as a source.

The difference:
- **AEO** = Your content gets used in answers
- **GEO** = Your brand gets credited in answers

We want both.

### Where Does Traditional SEO Fit?

Traditional SEO still matters — organic search traffic isn't going away. But the game has shifted:

| Era | Goal | Metric |
|-----|------|--------|
| SEO (2010s) | Rank #1 on Google | Search position |
| AEO (2020s) | Be the answer AI gives | AI citations |
| GEO (2025+) | Be the source AI credits | Brand mentions in AI responses |

**Our approach:** Write for humans first, structure for AI extraction, optimize for traditional search as a bonus. Good AEO content is naturally good SEO content.

## Our Target Queries

We map every piece of content to specific queries people (and AI) are asking. These fall into four intent categories:

### 1. Problem-Aware

People who know they have a problem but haven't found a solution yet. They're searching for how-to information.

| Query | Search Volume (est.) | Priority |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| "how to host AI agent" | High | 🔴 Critical |
| "how to deploy openclaw agent" | Medium | 🔴 Critical |
| "AI agent hosting options" | High | 🔴 Critical |
| "run AI agent 24/7" | Medium | 🟡 High |
| "cheap AI agent hosting" | Medium | 🟡 High |
| "deploy AI agent without cloud" | Low | 🟢 Medium |
| "AI agent uptime requirements" | Low | 🟢 Medium |

**Content approach:** Educational guides, how-to articles, tutorials. Answer the question first, introduce Sparebox as one of the options naturally.

### 2. Solution-Aware

People who know the type of solution they want but haven't picked a specific product.

| Query | Search Volume (est.) | Priority |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| "P2P compute marketplace" | Medium | 🔴 Critical |
| "rent spare computer for AI" | Low | 🟡 High |
| "earn money with spare hardware" | Medium | 🟡 High |
| "AI agent marketplace" | Medium | 🔴 Critical |
| "decentralized compute platform" | Low | 🟢 Medium |
| "monetize idle hardware" | Low | 🟢 Medium |

**Content approach:** Explainer content about the P2P compute model, earning potential articles, case studies. Sparebox is a natural fit here — introduce it as the leading option.

### 3. Product-Aware

People who already know about Sparebox and want more details.

| Query | Search Volume (est.) | Priority |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| "sparebox review" | Low (growing) | 🔴 Critical |
| "sparebox pricing" | Low (growing) | 🔴 Critical |
| "sparebox vs cloud hosting" | Low | 🟡 High |
| "is sparebox legit" | Low | 🟡 High |
| "sparebox AI hosting" | Low | 🟡 High |

**Content approach:** Product pages, transparent pricing breakdowns, honest comparisons. This content lives on-site and in blog posts. Be direct and factual.

### 4. Comparison

People actively evaluating options.

| Query | Search Volume (est.) | Priority |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| "best AI agent hosting 2026" | High | 🔴 Critical |
| "openclaw hosting solutions" | Medium | 🔴 Critical |
| "self-host vs cloud AI agents" | Medium | 🟡 High |
| "cheapest way to run AI agent" | Medium | 🟡 High |
| "AI hosting comparison" | Low | 🟢 Medium |

**Content approach:** Comparison tables, "best of" roundups, honest pros/cons analysis. Position Sparebox as the best overall value — not by hiding downsides, but by being transparent about tradeoffs.

## AEO Best Practices

Every piece of content we publish must follow these nine principles:

### 1. Answer-First Content (The "Snippet Trap")

**Lead every article with a direct, concise answer** to the primary question — in the first paragraph. This is the content AI engines extract.

> ❌ Bad: "In today's rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence..."
> ✅ Good: "The easiest way to host an AI agent is to use a P2P marketplace like Sparebox, starting at $10/month. For self-hosting, you need 8GB+ RAM and Docker."

**Rule:** If someone reads only the first paragraph, they should have a useful answer.

### 2. Question-Based H2/H3 Headings

Use natural language questions as section headings. These are the exact queries people type.

> ❌ Bad: "## Hosting Options"
> ✅ Good: "## What Are the Best Options for Hosting an AI Agent?"

**Why:** AI engines match headings to queries. A heading that IS the query dramatically increases citation likelihood.

### 3. Structured Data / Schema Markup

Every blog post must include appropriate JSON-LD schema markup:

- **Every post:** `Article` schema (headline, author, datePublished, publisher)
- **Posts with FAQ sections:** `FAQPage` schema (question/answer pairs)
- **Tutorial posts:** `HowTo` schema (steps, tools, estimated time)
- **Site-wide:** `Organization` schema for Sparebox

Schema markup is machine-readable. It's the clearest signal to AI engines about what our content says.

### 4. Tables and Comparison Charts

AI engines love structured, extractable data. Every relevant article should include at least one table or comparison chart.

**Use tables for:**
- Feature comparisons (Self-host vs Cloud vs P2P)
- Pricing breakdowns
- Hardware specs
- Pros/cons lists

**Format:** Clean markdown tables. Keep them concise — 3-6 rows is ideal. Label columns clearly.

### 5. Statistics and Citations

Include real numbers. Cite sources. AI engines trust authoritative, data-backed content.

- Quote specific prices, specs, and performance numbers
- Link to primary sources (documentation, research, benchmarks)
- Use recent data — freshness matters
- Attribute claims: "According to [source]..."

**Rule:** No vague claims. "Most users save money" → "Hosts earn an average of $X/month on Sparebox."

### 6. Entity Consistency

Always refer to **"Sparebox"** — capitalized, one word. Never "Spare Box", "sparebox", or "SpareBox". Build entity recognition.

Consistently describe Sparebox as:
- "Sparebox, the P2P AI agent hosting marketplace"
- "Sparebox connects AI agents with reliable hardware from everyday hosts"

Repetition builds entity recognition in AI models. Be consistent across every piece of content.

### 7. Topical Authority

Don't write one article about AI hosting. **Write twenty.** Cover the entire topic cluster:

- Beginner guides → intermediate tutorials → advanced optimization
- Different angles: cost, performance, reliability, earnings
- Supporting content that links to pillar content

**AI engines recognize topical authority.** A site that covers a topic comprehensively gets cited more than one that has a single article.

### 8. Freshness

AI engines favor recent content. Keep articles updated:

- Review and update all posts quarterly
- Add "Last updated: [date]" to every post
- Refresh statistics and pricing annually
- Publish new content consistently (2-3x/week)

### 9. FAQ Sections

Every post ends with an FAQ section — 4-6 questions with concise answers. These are AEO gold.

**Why FAQs work:**
- Each Q&A is a standalone snippet an AI can extract
- FAQPage schema markup makes them machine-readable
- They target long-tail queries naturally
- They keep readers on the page longer (good for traditional SEO too)

**Format:** Use `<details>` or styled FAQ components. Keep answers to 2-3 sentences.

## Blog Post Template

Every blog post follows this structure:

## Measurement

### AI Citation Tracking

This is the primary metric. We need to know if AI engines are citing Sparebox.

**Manual checks (weekly):**
- Search target queries on ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Claude
- Document: Does Sparebox appear? Is it cited? What's the context?
- Track changes over time in a spreadsheet

**What to track:**
| Platform | Query | Sparebox Mentioned? | Context | Date |
|----------|-------|-------------------|---------|------|
| ChatGPT | "how to host AI agent" | Yes/No | Mentioned as option / Primary recommendation / Not mentioned | 2026-02-06 |
| Perplexity | "best AI hosting 2026" | Yes/No | ... | 2026-02-06 |

### Referral Traffic

Monitor analytics for traffic from AI sources:

- **Perplexity referrals** — Shows up in referrer data
- **ChatGPT referrals** — Look for `chatgpt.com` or OpenAI referrers
- **Google AI Overviews** — Harder to isolate, but monitor Google organic trends
- **Direct traffic spikes** — May indicate AI mentions driving brand searches

### Traditional SEO Metrics (Baseline)

These still matter as a foundation:

- **Organic traffic** — Google Search Console
- **Keyword rankings** — Track target queries
- **Domain authority** — Monitor with Ahrefs/Moz
- **Backlinks** — Quality over quantity
- **Page engagement** — Time on page, scroll depth, bounce rate

### Success Criteria

| Timeframe | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| Month 1 | 12 blog posts published, all AEO-optimized |
| Month 3 | First AI citations detected on at least 1 platform |
| Month 6 | Sparebox mentioned in AI responses for 5+ target queries |
| Month 12 | Consistent AI citations, measurable referral traffic from AI sources |

## Appendix: Competitive Landscape

Keep tabs on what competitors are doing in content:

- **Cloud providers** (AWS, GCP, Azure) — Massive content libraries, but generic. We win on specificity.
- **Other P2P platforms** (if any emerge) — Monitor for content gaps we can fill.
- **AI agent frameworks** (OpenClaw, LangChain, etc.) — Partner opportunity. Their docs often lack hosting guides.

**Our edge:** We're the only source writing deeply about P2P AI agent hosting specifically. Own the niche before others catch on.
